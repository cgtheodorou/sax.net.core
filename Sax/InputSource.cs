  ///     This class allows a SAX application to encapsulate information
  ///     about an input source in a single object, which may include
  ///     a public identifier, a system identifier, a byte stream (possibly
  ///     with a specified encoding), and/or a character stream.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     There are two places that the application can deliver an
  ///     input source to the parser: as the argument to the Parser.parse
  ///     method, or as the return value of the EntityResolver.resolveEntity
  ///     method.
  ///   </para>
  ///   <para>
  ///     The SAX parser will use the InputSource object to determine how
  ///     to read XML input.  If there is a character stream available, the
  ///     parser will read that stream directly, disregarding any text
  ///     encoding declaration found in that stream.
  ///     If there is no character stream, but there is
  ///     a byte stream, the parser will use that byte stream, using the
  ///     encoding specified in the InputSource or else (if no encoding is
  ///     specified) autodetecting the character encoding using an algorithm
  ///     such as the one in the XML specification.  If neither a character
  ///     stream nor a
  ///     byte stream is available, the parser will attempt to open a URL
  ///     connection to the resource identified by the system
  ///     identifier.

  ///     shall never modify it in any way (it may modify a copy if
  ///     necessary).  However, standard processing of both byte and
  ///     character streams is to close them on as part of end-of-parse cleanup,
  ///     so applications should not attempt to re-use such streams after they
  ///     have been handed to a parser.
